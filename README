This repository contains an end-to-end research project focused on **Causal Machine Learning** in oncology. Using multimodal data from **The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)**, the project estimates individualized treatment effects to pave the way for personalized therapeutic strategies.

In clinical oncology, the Average Treatment Effect (ATE) often masks how different patient subgroups respond to therapy. This project implements state-of-the-art causal inference methods to identify which specific patient characteristics (clinical and genomic) drive treatment heterogeneity.

* **Target:** Breast Cancer (TCGA-BRCA) dataset.
* **Data:** Multimodal integration of clinical variables and high-dimensional RNA-seq gene expression.
* **Methodology:** Implementation of **Causal Forests** (via GRF) and **Meta-learners** (S-, T-, and X-learners).
* **Validation:** Propensity score overlap diagnostics, covariate balance checks, and policy value evaluation.
